# PKMN Twitter - Archive #

Thanks to @screenshakes you can play Pokemon Crystal in a Twitter propic!

This bot pulls the profile picture every 10 seconds and merge them in a GIF, which is then sent to a Telegram channel. This way is easier to see what is happening in the playthrough and can be used as an archive.
